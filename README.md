# Face-Recognition
Face recognition on AT&T face dataset.

Dependencies- Python v3.6.3, NumPy v1.14.0, TensorFlow v1.4.0, scikit-learn v0.19.1, matplotlib v2.1.0

Multi-class image classification - 40 classes (faces); dimentionality was reduced by Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis, followed by Suport Vector Classifier, and various architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks. Underfitting was dealt with, by regularizing the network and by data augmentation.
